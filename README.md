### My First Webpage
I completed this HTML and CSS project - my portfolio webpage during progate code and build in web development week.

#### The webpage welcome section
The webpage consists of four main sections: About me, Skills, Projects, and Connect. The navigation bar is always at the top of the viewport. You click on links to navigate to different sections of the page.
